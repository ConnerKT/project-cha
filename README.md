# project-cha

Project cha is a video chat application that will allow users to randomly call users.

stack (if i remember to update lol)

vite
react
webrtc
daisyui
firebase

maybe socket.io for the chat portion just gotta feel like doing it.

## Goals

Have the landing page be a sign in, then once signed in they will be able to click chat now.

Adding loading error handling for slow host (render sucks)
